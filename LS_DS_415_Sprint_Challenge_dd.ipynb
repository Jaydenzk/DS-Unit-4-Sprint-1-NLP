Apply your newly acquired skills to one of the most famous NLP datasets out there: [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge). As part of the job selection process, some of my friends have been asked to create analysis of this dataset, so I want to empower you to have a head start.  \n","\n","The real dataset is massive (almost 8 gigs uncompressed). I've sampled the data for you to something more managable for the Sprint Challenge. You can analyze the full dataset as a stretch goal or after the sprint challenge.
